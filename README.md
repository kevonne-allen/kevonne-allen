CloudTrail → CloudWatch Logs integration is standard—not S3, not Kinesis
CloudWatch Agent ONLY delivers to CloudWatch Logs—no direct S3 or Kinesis option
CloudWatch Logs Insights is the unified query tool—Athena cannot query CloudWatch Logs
256 KB event size limitation applies to CloudTrail → CloudWatch Logs delivery
Two separate IAM roles may be needed: CloudTrail role and EC2 CloudWatch Agent role
Log group location matters: CloudTrail log group must be in the same AWS account
StackSets is purpose-built for multi-account CloudFormation deployments in AWS Organizations
Service-managed permissions eliminate manual IAM role creation
Automatic deployment on new account creation is a native StackSet feature
No extra code required—declarative infrastructure-as-code via CloudFormation
EventBridge + Lambda adds unnecessary complexity without operational benefit
Systems Manager Automation is for operational tasks, not infrastructure provisioning
Organization Trails handle CloudTrail logging but not resource provisioning
Unified management from management account—no need to access individual accounts
AWS Config Rules are purpose-built for configuration compliance assessment—not CloudWatch Logs, CloudTrail, or EventBridge
Two evaluation triggers exist: Configuration changes (immediate) and Periodic (scheduled)
Custom rules enable test-driven compliance development
CloudTrail logs API activities for audit trail and forensics, not configuration compliance
CloudWatch Logs Agent is for application/system logs—not AWS resource configuration monitoring
Auto-remediation (Lambda + EventBridge) violates auditing requirements—the mandate is monitoring, not fixing
KMS encryption secures CloudTrail logs for compliance purposes
Managed + Custom rules together provide both quick-start compliance and organization-specific standards
CloudWatch Logs Subscriptions enable real-time event-driven processing—not alarms or metrics
Subscription filters deliver events to Lambda, Kinesis, or Firehose—enabling custom automation
CloudWatch alarms DO NOT support direct Lambda invocation—SNS is the intermediary
EventBridge scheduled rules use rate or cron expressions—no second-level precision
Step Functions is for complex orchestration—not for simple two-step automation
Fully automated solutions require no human intervention—eliminating manual approval options
Log events are base64-encoded and gzip-compressed—Lambda must decode them
EventBridge Scheduler is preferred over scheduled rules for new implementations
Batch processing by subscriptions is not guaranteed—but typically occurs for optimization
Subscription filters retry for 24 hours on retryable errors—ensuring eventual delivery
Stack drift detects unmanaged configuration changes—resources modified outside CloudFormation
Drift detection requires CloudFormation DetectStackDrift API invocation—subject to rate limits
Throttling errors result in NON_COMPLIANT status—AWS Config defaults to non-compliant when API is unavailable
Rule execution timeout is 15 minutes maximum—large stacks may exceed this
Solution for throttling: restrict rule scope using tags—create multiple rule instances for tag-based subsets
Custom resources are NOT supported for drift detection—CloudFormation skips them entirely
Permission errors have explicit messaging—different from throttling errors
Explicitly set properties drift; defaults don't—CloudFormation only tracks intentional configuration
IAM role must have cloudformation:DetectStackDrift permission
Multiple rule instances can evaluate different stack groups—avoiding throttling while maintaining comprehensive coverage
VPC peering is required for cross-account EFS access—provides network connectivity
EFS file system policy must grant permissions—not SCPs
Lambda execution role needs two types of permissions: VPC access + EFS access
Cross-region EFS + Lambda is NOT supported—architectural limitation
Cross-AZ within same account uses VPC routing—Lambda automatically selects correct mount target
EFS access points enforce path and permission isolation—enable safe multi-function sharing
Data transfer charges apply to cross-account peering—trade-off vs. duplicate EFS
No user-configured policy = default full access via mount targets
elasticfilesystem:ClientMount and ClientWrite are required for EFS access
Mount path in Lambda is user-specified (e.g., /mnt/efs)—appears as local directory
UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED occurs when rollback itself fails—not the original update
Common cause: external resource changes—CloudFormation doesn't know about them
ContinueUpdateRollback is the recovery command—not drift detection or StackSets
Manual fixes must precede ContinueUpdateRollback—address root cause first
Drift detection is observational, not corrective—wrong tool for recovery
StackSets is for multi-account orchestration—not single-stack recovery
Reapplying original template won't help—root cause still exists
ResourcesToSkip is a last resort—creates template inconsistency
Stack must be fixed before subsequent updates—to avoid cascading failures
CloudFormation requires stable external state to complete rollbacks
ABAC is tag-based authorization—allows/denies based on tag matching
ABAC scales automatically with new resources—no policy updates needed
RBAC requires manual policy updates for new resources
Single ABAC policy covers multiple resources—vs. many RBAC policies
Tags are applied to both IAM roles and AWS resources
Condition uses ${aws:PrincipalTag/key} and aws:ResourceTag/key—for matching
SCPs don't grant permissions—they set maximum permissions, not granular access
Resource-based policies still require manual attachment per resource—not scalable
ACLs are cross-account only—can't control same-account access
ABAC enables dynamic response to organizational change—teams grow without policy rewrites
S3 bucket name MUST start with aws-waf-logs-—mandatory requirement, not optional
S3 bucket suffix can be anything—provides flexibility in naming
Bucket must be in same AWS account as WAF—cross-account logging not supported
Log files delivered every 5 minutes—batched delivery interval
Maximum file size is 75 MB—larger files split automatically
Logs are gzip compressed—must decompress to read
AWS WAF supports only customer-managed KMS keys—NOT AWS-managed keys
Kinesis Stream as Firehose source is NOT recommended—adds unnecessary complexity
CloudWatch Logs naming requirement: aws-waf-logs-—same as S3
Log file storage path includes account ID, region, web ACL name, and timestamp—enables organizing large log volumes
Metric Filters convert log data to metrics—enabling numeric analysis and alarming
Filter patterns define what to look for—using symbolic syntax for log interpretation
Custom metrics are published in real-time—enabling responsive alerting
CloudWatch Alarms watch metrics and trigger actions—including SNS notifications
Metric Filters are NOT retroactive—only filter logs created after filter creation
SNS email subscriptions require confirmation—subscribers must click confirmation link
Metric Streams are NOT for log filtering—and Firehose is not a supported destination
Transit Gateway Flow Logs are network-level—not application security events
Lambda Insights monitors Lambda functions—not firewall logs
Dimensions enable multi-dimensional metrics—separate metrics per dimension value
Default value ensures data in every period—preventing "spotty" metric data
Evaluate multiple periods to reduce false alarms—set datapoints-to-alarm threshold
CodePipeline Lambda actions enable custom automation—triggered at specific pipeline stages
Event-driven automation is superior to schedule-driven—better efficiency and responsiveness
CloudFront invalidation requires cloudfront:CreateInvalidation—not S3 API
API Gateway SDK can be programmatically downloaded—via SDK generation API
Lambda is required for custom logic—CodePipeline has no native SDK export capability
CodePipeline integration with API Gateway for SDK export does not exist—common exam distractor
S3 has no cache invalidation API—only CloudFront can invalidate
Scheduled triggers waste resources—event-driven triggers are more efficient
Lambda must notify CodePipeline of success/failure—to mark pipeline stage complete
CloudFront distribution required for SDK distribution—enables global access and caching
SDK invalidation path should be broad (e.g., /sdks/*)—invalidates all versions simultaneously
API ID and stage name are required parameters for SDK download—extracted from pipeline input
DeletionPolicy: Retain preserves resources when stack deletes—fundamental attribute for retention
Retain can be applied to any resource type—not limited to specific services
Retained resources continue to incur charges—they remain in the account
Import allows resources to be managed by new stacks—re-establishing CloudFormation control
Snapshot still deletes the resource—it only creates a backup before deletion
Hooks are for policy enforcement—not resource management or retention
DependsOn is for resource dependencies—not for retention or stack relationships
Five-step process: Deploy → Retain → Delete → Import → Remove Retain
Not all resources support import—must verify before attempting import
Test in non-production first—to avoid data loss on critical resources
Resource identifiers must be accurate for import—vpc-id, bucket names, instance IDs
Stack renaming requires complete delete/recreate—no direct rename operation in CloudFormation
StackSets enable multi-Region, multi-account deployment from one template—purpose-built for this use case
Single template deployed consistently across all stack instances—ensures uniformity
CLI create-stack supports only --region (singular), not multiple Regions—requires separate commands
Shell scripts are not elegant solutions for what StackSets provide natively—avoid custom complexity
Change sets are for previewing updates—not for multi-Region deployment
StackSet is a regional resource—created in one Region, manages stacks across Regions
Stack instances are created for each Account × Region combination
Deployment preferences control parallelism and failure tolerance—enable safe at-scale operations
Updates to StackSet automatically update all stack instances—no selective updates
Self-managed vs. service-managed permissions—choose based on AWS Organizations usage
Stack instance status: CURRENT (up-to-date), OUTDATED (behind), INOPERABLE (failed)
Retain stacks option—keep resources when removing stack instances
CloudWatch Agent collects logs from EC2 instances—sends every 5 seconds by default
Metric filters create metrics from log patterns—enable alarming on log events
Metric filters are different from subscription filters—metric filters create metrics; subscriptions stream data
Real-time monitoring latency: ~2 minutes from login to email notification
CloudTrail logs API calls, not system logins—captures different event types
CloudTrail delivery time: ~5 minutes (not guaranteed)—too slow for real-time monitoring
Amazon Inspector scans for vulnerabilities—not for login detection
SNS enables multi-recipient alerting—email, SMS, webhooks supported
Default metric value of 0 ensures metric data in every period—prevents "spotty" data
Agent requires IAM permissions to write to CloudWatch Logs
Log pattern syntax is flexible—supports text search and JSON parsing
Alarms on Sum statistic are typical for event counting (login events)
Content-MD5 header provides upload-time integrity verification—validates data during transmission
ETag is returned in response and can be compared to calculated MD5—confirms data wasn't corrupted
S3 returns BadDigest error if MD5s don't match—prevents storage of corrupted objects
ETag reflects content changes only, not metadata changes—metadata modifications don't change ETag
For single-part, unencrypted uploads: ETag = MD5 digest—enables easy verification
For multipart uploads: ETag ≠ simple MD5—composite hash used instead
For encrypted objects: ETag ≠ MD5—encryption affects ETag calculation
For directory buckets: ETag ≠ MD5—different calculation method
Trailing checksums are AWS-calculated, not user-provided—cannot be manually provided
Custom metadata is not used for integrity verification—must use Content-MD5 header
Version ID is for tracking versions, not data integrity—completely different purpose
MD5 must be Base64-encoded in Content-MD5 header—not hexadecimal format
CloudFormation service role decouples user permissions from CloudFormation permissions—enables fine-grained control
Service role must have REQUIRED permissions, not full permissions—least privilege principle
PassRole permission is REQUIRED for developers to specify service role—mandatory step
PassRole must specify exact role ARN in Resource element—prevents privilege escalation
ResourceTag condition on PassRole does NOT work reliably—use resource ARN instead
SourceIp condition should NOT be used with CloudFormation—CloudFormation makes calls from its own IP
Service role cannot be removed after stack is created—plan carefully before creating stack
All stack operations use the specified service role—no selective role per operation
PassRole is NOT an API call and doesn't appear in CloudTrail—permission check only
Principle of least privilege applies to both service role and developer role—minimize granted permissions
Lambda is required to implement custom filtering logic for Glue job events—EventBridge alone cannot detect retry failures​
Job run ID contains retry information (e.g., _attempt_1)—Lambda examines this to detect retries​
Direct EventBridge-to-SNS cannot filter for retry-specific failures—too generic without custom logic​
Lambda examines event details and decides whether to publish SNS notification—conditional filtering​
Retry failures indicated by _attempt_1 suffix in job run ID—key pattern to match​
SNS is the notification mechanism—delivers to email, SMS, or other endpoints
SQS DLQs are for message handling—not for Glue job retry orchestration or notifications
Personal Health Dashboard is for AWS infrastructure—not for application job monitoring​
EventBridge event patterns enable initial filtering—but Lambda adds specific business logic
Lambda must publish SNS conditionally—only when specific conditions (retry failure) are met​
CloudWatch Logs capture Lambda execution for auditing and debugging
Multiple retry attempts can occur, but notification typically only on first retry failure
Lambda MUST send response to pre-signed S3 URL—critical requirement for stack completion
Pre-signed URL provided in CloudFormation request—Lambda extracts and uses it
Response must include Status: SUCCESS or FAILED—determines stack operation outcome
cfn-response module simplifies response sending—available only for ZipFile inline code
If response not received, stack stays in-progress forever—until timeout (1 hour default)
CloudFormation waits at pre-signed URL for response—blocks stack operation until response arrives
Custom resource provider and template developer can be same person—roles are organizational, not technical
ResponseURL must be used exactly as provided—no modification or redirection
Response includes PhysicalResourceId—update detection uses this value
Output data from response accessible via Fn::GetAtt—template developer can retrieve via function
Manual response sending required for S3-based code—cfn-response only for inline ZipFile
Timeout can be customized via ServiceTimeout property—adjust for expected response time
Firewall Manager is for centralized security policy enforcement—not threat detection
Three prerequisites: AWS Organizations, Administrator Account, AWS Config—all mandatory
Policies define WAF rules and scope—automatically applied to matching resources
Scope based on accounts, resource types, tags—granular control
Policies apply to new AND existing resources—proactive protection
GuardDuty is reactive (responds to threats), not proactive policy enforcement
AWS Config is prerequisite, not replacement—detects resources for Firewall Manager
Systems Manager irrelevant—operational tool, not security policy tool
Enables distributed development with centralized security oversight—solves core tension
Partner rules can be integrated—replicate on-premises security posture
Individual accounts can add rules to Firewall Manager web ACLs—flexible baseline model
Auto-remediation option available—can automatically fix non-compliant resources
Systems Manager Agent required on all instances—enables patch operations
AWS-RunPatchBaseline supports Windows, Linux, and macOS—recommended document
AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline Windows-only—cannot use for Linux
Patch baselines define approval rules—classification, severity, days to approve
Test in pre-production before production deployment—reduces production risk
Maintenance windows automate scheduling—eliminates manual patching
Approval workflow required—document and validate patches before production
CloudFormation is for provisioning, not patching—Systems Manager handles ongoing patches
OS-native patching violates scalability requirement—not suitable for enterprise
Compliance reporting provides audit trail—track who, what, when of patching
CRON/Rate expressions for scheduling—automate execution without manual intervention
Reboot options configurable—balance patching with availability requirements
Trust relationship in application account role—trusts DevOps CodeBuild role
Trust direction critical: Application role trusts DevOps, not reverse
sts:AssumeRole enables cross-account access—CodeBuild assumes application role
Application role needs EKS permissions: eks:DescribeCluster, eks:AccessKubernetesApi
aws-auth ConfigMap maps IAM roles to Kubernetes users/groups
Kubernetes RBAC provides final authorization layer
AssumeRoleWithSAML for external federation—not for cross-account AWS access
Reverse trust direction breaks the flow—CodeBuild cannot assume the role
Three-layer security model: AWS IAM → EKS API → Kubernetes RBAC
Role session name important for audit trail—visible in CloudTrail
Resource ARNs in policies limit scope—don't use wildcards
ClusterRoleBinding completes the RBAC chain—maps Kubernetes groups to permissions
10% margin (or 1 instance, whichever is greater) during rebalancing—temporary capacity override
Launch before terminate—maintains availability during rebalancing
Margin only during rebalancing—not during regular scale-out
Margin only when at/near max—when margin would be needed
AZ balance takes absolute precedence—more important than any termination policy
Newer instances can be terminated before older—if needed for AZ balance
Mixed instances: identify purchase type first—determine Spot vs. On-Demand
Then apply termination policy per AZ—independently per zone
Can temporarily cause AZ imbalance—but corrected in later operations
Billing hour is last tiebreaker—not primary criterion
One custom Lambda policy possible—not multiple policies
Default termination policy prioritizes configurations—outdated configs first, then billing hour
SAM provides built-in traffic shifting for Lambda—no need for manual CodeDeploy config
CloudFormation alone cannot do Lambda traffic shifting—requires SAM
AutoPublishAlias automatically creates/updates Lambda aliases—SAM managed
DeploymentPreference defines traffic-shifting pattern—Canary or Linear
PreTraffic hook runs before any traffic shifts—early error detection
PostTraffic hook runs after traffic fully shifted—live traffic validation
CloudWatch alarms trigger automatic rollback—no manual intervention needed
Canary pattern: 2-phase shift (e.g., 10% then 100%)
Linear pattern: equal increments (e.g., 10% every minute)
Change sets don't reduce error detection time—preview only, no testing
Pre-traffic tests prevent bad code from reaching users—fail fast
Rollback is automatic and instant—no manual switchover required
Target tracking specifies metric and target value—Application Auto Scaling handles the rest
Application Auto Scaling creates/manages CloudWatch alarms automatically—don't create manually
Scale-out is aggressive, scale-in is conservative—prevents flapping
Inverse metric relationship required—doubling capacity should halve utilization
50% CPU utilization provides spare capacity—handles traffic spikes
Scheduled scaling for predictable patterns—weekly, daily, seasonal
Target tracking + Scheduled scaling together—proactive + reactive
Step scaling for complex thresholds—more complex than target tracking
Lambda not supported by step scaling—use other mechanisms
Spot Fleets fully supported—target tracking and scheduled scaling
CRON expressions for scheduled actions—specify exact times
Target tracking simpler than step scaling—prefer unless complex requirements
16 MB threshold for multipart (not 50 MB)—console auto-switches at this size​
Single-part = direct checksum—MD5 of entire object​
Multipart = composite checksum—MD5 of part checksums​
Checksum changes when method changes—expected behavior​
Console operations (>16 MB) trigger multipart—rename, copy, metadata edit​
ETag format shows upload method—"-NN" suffix = multipart​
Developer's single-part calculation was correct—not a calculation error​
Composite calculation is correct for multipart—not an error either​
Both methods follow AWS design—this is intentional​
Algorithm doesn't change—MD5 stays MD5, CRC64 stays CRC64​
Calculation METHOD changes—direct vs. composite​
Can't directly compare checksums across methods—different approaches entirely​
Blue/Green uses two identical environments—blue (current) and green (new)​
Deploy code BEFORE switching traffic—never reverse this order​
Rolling restart deploys to green—gradual instance replacement​
ALB listener rule switches traffic—points to different target group​
Single ALB scenario: Use target group switching, NOT Route 53​
Zero downtime due to load balancer switching—application never offline​
Quick rollback capability—switch back to blue if needed​
Blue kept standby or terminated—balance cost vs. rollback speed​
Health checks must pass—before traffic directed to green​
All-at-once deployment = downtime—not compatible with Blue/Green​
Route 53 swap irrelevant with single ALB—one endpoint only​
ALB rule modification is instant—no DNS propagation delay​
Terminating:Wait is the correct state—pauses before termination​
Lifecycle hooks provide time window for custom actions—default 1 hour​
CloudWatch Events monitors Terminating:Wait events—triggers automation​
Systems Manager automation document runs cleanup logic—PowerShell, create AMI, signal completion​
InputTransformer extracts values from CloudWatch events—passes to automation parameters​
Patch Manager not suitable—for patching only, not custom logic​
Maintenance Windows not suitable—scheduled, not event-driven​
Multiple IAM roles needed—automation role and CloudWatch Events role​
CompleteLifecycleAction signals ASG to proceed—moves to Terminating:Proceed​
Terminating:Pending does NOT exist—invalid state​
Domain removal before termination—prevents orphaned domain objects​
AMI creation preserves instance state—for recovery or auditing purposes
AllowTraffic failure + No Logs = Load Balancer Health Check Issue—Golden rule for CodeDeploy exam questions.​
Lifecycle scripts (ApplicationStart, etc.) ALWAYS generate logs if they run.​
AllowTraffic executes on the Load Balancer, not the instance—hence no local logs.​
Terminated instances cause timeouts (1 hour), not immediate silent failures.​
Review Target Group settings to resolve ALB-related deployment failures.
